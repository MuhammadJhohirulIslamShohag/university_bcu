Shouldn't that have been exactly 2.5? Well, computers count in twos, and we count in tens.
Computers don't always store numbers with fractions exactly, and we can't always on paper or
in our organic memories either. How many decimal places are needed to store 1/3rd exactly?
There's no such thing as infinite memory, so we have to allocate a reasonable quantity.

Ex:01
Write a Python script that will calculate the square root of the equation B*B + 4 * A *
C. (hints you can use three variables to store the values of A, B and C). Note: to
calculate square root of a number x, you need to implement the following x**(1/2.0) 

'''
a = 2
b=3
c = 5
x = b*b + 4 * a * c 
print(x**(1/2.0))

'''
2) Write a Python script that calculates the sum, average and population standard
deviation of 5 numbers stored in the variables a,b,c,d,e The formula to calculate the
standard deviation of a number can be found below. To ensure that your calculation is
correct, use the following 5 numbers 9, 8, 12, 33, 5 and assign then into the 5
12variables a, b, c, d, e. The population standard deviation should equal to
10.051865498503252.
